        "This notebook demonstrates how large language models can be used as a **practical data-cleaning tool for unstructured text**. Many social science datasets—interviews, reports, policy documents, open-ended survey responses—contain valuable information that is difficult to analyse in raw form. Entity extraction turns this text into structured variables (people, organisations, locations, dates) that can be reviewed, filtered, and analysed at scale. The focus here is not prediction, but **reducing manual cleaning and coding effort while preserving interpretability and research control**.\n",
